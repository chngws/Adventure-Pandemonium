        <p>Taking a deep breath you open the macabre tome: it is written in the same alien language as its cover, but filled with disturbing diagrams of extracting blood from live humans and processing them via distillation to produce a liquid. It does not contain any diagrams of what the liquid is used for, but you cannot think of anything good out of it.</p>
        <p>You pause to consider the knowledge you just gained about the denizens of this estate, and of the purpose of this laboratory. Reduce one fear point.</p>
