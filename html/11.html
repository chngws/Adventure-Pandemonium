        <p>The window is locked, and barricaded with iron bars from the outside. The fog is denser now and almost impermeable, and you can barely make out the shape of your car and the front gate you entered from. Suddenly, you notice two figures in white robes come out of the front door and entering your car! They drove it into the garage and disappeared after. Add one fear point.</p>
        <p>Your anxiety grows and you wonder who were they and why did they dispose of your car.</p>
