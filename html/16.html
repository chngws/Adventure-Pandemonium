        <h1>16.</h1>
        <p>The Sathanus room is unlocked, upon entering you see that all its walls and ceiling are painted red. The room is bare of any furniture except a crude wooden chair in the middle. On the chair is a bloodied whip with many ends, each end having many barbs around it. It took you a moment to realize this room is used for self-flagellation, with the user sitting on the chair and whipping himself with the barbed whip.</p>
        <p>The hairs on your neck bristled as goosebumps laminated all over your naked skin upon realization, and you hastily leave the Sathanus room and close the door shut behind you. Add one fear point.</p>
