        <p>The hedge garden is largely unkept, with the hedge sculptures growing out into strange shapes and forms. In the middle of the garden is a stone fountain which no longer flows, the water stagnant and murky.</p>
        <p>Apart from reminding you of the dropping temperatures, there seem to be nothing of interest in the hedge garden. You were about to leave when you spotted a small doll sticking out of one of the hedges. It appears that the doll seems to be thrown out from one of the windows above, but there is no light from any of them.</p>
        <p>Will you...</p>
