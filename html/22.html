My name Delano, and whom may you be?"</p>
        <p>A thin figure rises from the armchair and turns around to greet you. It is a pale-skinned man, in his late forties but spotting a full head of jet black hair, dressed in a quilted robe. His eyes are a crimson red and meets your gaze with fierce intensity.</p>
