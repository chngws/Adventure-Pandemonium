        <h1>2.</h1>
        <p>Moments after knocking you hear voices and hurried steps towards the door. The door unbolted and swung open as you come face to face with your hosts... </p>
        <p>The first of two is a tall man with broad shoulders and sharp features, dressed in a grey evening robe, you estimate he is of about fourty of age. The other is an older man in a butler's uniform, his age showing in his balding scalp and slightly hunched over posture, he appears nervous and avoids your eye contact.</p>
        <p>The first of the two appears undisturbed by his companion's demeanour and warmly greets you, "My name is Alessandro and I welcome you to my home, this here is Tristram and he serves as our butler. What pleasure do I owe for the visit tonight?"</p>
        <p>Sharing that you are stranded due to the fog and unable to continue your journey out of the wood, Alessandro offers to provide a room for you to rest while waiting for the fog to clear. Seeing no better alternative, you agree and enter the estate. Tristram takes your coat without a word and hangs it, before bolting the door.</p>
