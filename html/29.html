        <p>You try to scream or move but the Vampire's hypnotic gaze robs you of control of your body. Fortunately, as he approaches you he catches whiff of the garlic and gags. The hypnosis breaks and you catch your breath. Before the Vampire recovers you throw garlic at him and he vomits profusely on the carpet. You quickly make your way out of the room.</p>
